                'content': f'''# Basic Rules

Welcome to the {game_name} rules guide. Please read and understand these before playing.

## Core Principles

1. **Respect**: Treat all players and staff with respect
2. **Consent**: Obtain consent for mature or potentially triggering content
3. **Immersion**: Stay in character in IC areas
4. **Fairness**: Play fair and don't metagame or powergame

## Roleplay Guidelines

### IC vs OOC
- **IC (In Character)**: Your character's actions and words
- **OOC (Out of Character)**: You as a player

Keep IC and OOC separate. IC actions have IC consequences.

### Consent and Boundaries
- Respect player boundaries
- Discuss mature themes beforehand
- Use safety tools (X-card, fade-to-black)

### Power Gaming
Don't:
- Auto-hit other characters
- Ignore damage or consequences
- Declare outcomes without rolls
- Use OOC knowledge IC (metagaming)

## Dice System

We use Chronicles of Darkness 2nd Edition mechanics:
- Roll attribute + skill
- 8+ is a success
- 10 counts as two successes
- Dramatic failure on no successes and a 1

## Character Death

Character death is possible but should be meaningful:
- Always requires consent for PvP death
- NPCs may kill without consent in dangerous situations
- Death should advance story, not just happen randomly

## Getting Help

Questions? Contact staff:
- Use the +jobs system
- Page a staff member
- Ask in the OOC channel
