That mummies exist at all is barely known to creatures who consider themselves well-kept secrets. Yet there are secrets within secrets, immortals shrouded from notice and attention. Books about them are lost or perish in mysterious fires. An endless string of improbable coincidences lead investigators through wild good chases or frustrating dead ends. Whenever a character takes an action intended to learn about the mummy, track her, or locate her, he suffers a penalty equal to the Enigma rating. This penalty does not inhibit basic perception checks to notice the mummy or contest attempts at stealth unless the mummy's attempting to hide in a crowd. Enigma does not make one invisible, just unremarkable. Members of the mummy's cult reverse the Enigma rating, applying it as a bonus whenever it should apply. In this way, followers may find their hidden demigod without exposing her to enemies and outsiders. Of course, nothing stops enemies from forcing an Arisen's cultists to serve as 'native guides' to plunder her tomb, or worse.",

Since they are all impossibly ancient beings, it isn't age the Arisen respect, but their own social structures—the five guilds—and they do so instinctively. Each Arisen is a member of one of the five guilds, and thus has at least Guild Status • in her guild. Each guild subdivides its membership into three categories, represented by titles: apprentices (Guild Status •), journeymen (Guild Status •• through ••••), and guildmasters (Guild Status •••••). A player can add her mummy's dots in Guild Status to dice pools for social interactions with members of the Arisen's own guild. As with other uses of Status, these dots are not added to dice pools predicated on supernatural powers such as Affinities and Utterances. A mummy can't ever have more than one form of Guild Status; e.g., if she has any dots in Guild Status (Maa-Kep), she can't also have dots in Guild Status (Su-Menent). When a mummy leaves her guild, she loses all Guild Status dots in that guild and gains Guild Status • in a different guild. When she does, she loses access to her former Guild Affinity and gains use of his new guild's Affinity; this happens automatically, without experience expenditure.",

It is the strong shield the Judges gave her against the fears of ignorant mortals and the ravages of aeons, but it is also the mightiest shackle they placed upon her will. It protects even as it enslaves. Mechanically, players can put up to 10 Merit dots into Tomb, spread between the Geometry, Peril, and Endowments aspects.

The geometry of a mummy's tomb is incalculably more sophisticated. It drains magic out of the sky, the soil, even the gazes of those who unknowingly gawp at it, and keeps that energy ready for its resident. • Perhaps two meters square with a sarcophagus. The interior is lined with worn carvings etched into the walls. Adds one die to attempts to recharge Pillars. •• The size of a small office, completely covered with carvings that look fresh and sharp. Adds two dice to attempts to recharge Pillars. ••• Underground, the burial hold lies beyond an antechamber filled with plunder and guarded by elegant statues and racks of prized possessions. Here and there, a highlight is picked out in gold or precious stones. Above the ground (at the time of the tomb's construction) a statue or obelisk jutted, though by now its inscriptions are worn and difficult to decipher. Adds three dice to attempts to recharge Pillars. •••• The aboveground element is an imposing statue, eerily untouched by the storms and vagaries of ages.

Adds four dice to attempts to recharge Pillars. ••••• A breathtaking monument—perhaps a sphinx about the size of a school bus—stands atop this tomb (unless the intervening centuries have buried it under the shifting sands). A staircase and passage lead to a maze of at least a dozen rooms cluttered with weapons, masks, stelae, and ritual tools, all preserved as if they were used yesterday. Guardian statues glare from corners, while the gleam of gold and lapis lazuli strike richly from every surface, even in the dimmest torchlight. Adds five dice to attempts to recharge Pillars.",

        description="Transgressing a mummy's crypt is dangerous, to say the least. The foremost danger is that its inhabitant is going to wake up, but some are perilous in their own right, even without an undead guardian lurching forth in rage. This peril can take two forms: Material traps, or an immaterial curse. Material traps range from standard architectural hazards (pits with spikes, a plummeting stone block) to more elaborate devices (spring-loaded darts, a room that seals itself and fills with sand, or a breeding pit for scorpions). Either way, they're presumably cleaned and reset by the inhabitant, or her agents. Material traps are triggered in a small area and do a point of lethal damage and a point of bashing damage for every dot allocated to this Merit aspect. The mummy can have one big trap or several small ones, as desired, but no matter how one handles it, players of interlopers get a Wits + Composure roll for their characters to notice a trap before it springs. Should they succeed, the trap has discharged without harming them, though it may have temporarily blocked their passage forward or backward. The curse, on the other hand, takes the form of a sinking unease, a profound yet sourceless distress that begins 100 feet from the tomb for every point invested. People who take the hint and stay back suffer no ill effects. Roll a pool of dice equal to their Willpower for those who push on and violate the tomb. If it succeeds, they can overcome the terror without further ado. Should it fail, they have to pay Willpower points to enter. The Willpower required is equal to the dots spent on Tomb (Peril).

If the character is a researcher, the curio proves he was right all along and gets him tenure. If the character is a mage, it's a vital clue to one of those things wizards get all uptight about.

It is unknown what makes a companion spontaneously arise, though mummies have offered many theories over the millennia. Some believe Witnesses were beloved spouses or concubines whose souls were bound with necromancy to reincarnate and rejoin their loves in future Descents. Others believe they bear souls fit for the Rite of Return. Some Utterances and Affinities can transform mortals into Witnesses outright, either temporarily or permanently. Regardless of origin, Witnesses have always stood by the Arisen as servants, friends, and even occasional nemeses. If mortal, the character gains total immunity to Sybaris (supernatural companions are already immune). Additionally, he also feels an obsessive fascination with the Arisen. Whenever presented with an opportunity to accompany or learn more about mummies, he must do so unless his player makes a successful Wits + Composure roll. Success allows the Witness to act as desired for the rest of the day. Apply a cumulative –1 to the check per month since he last indulged his fascination (maximum –5). Such indulgence must dominate most waking activity for at least a week to reset the penalty to zero. Note that Witnesses aren't compelled to seek out the Arisen constantly. The obsession only flares up in the presence of a mummy or clues that would lead to the Arisen (or genuine information about them). Finally, the mortal gains a limited sixth sense, intuitively recognizing Arisen or the Lifeless as such upon perceiving them directly, in person.
