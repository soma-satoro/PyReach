The trod bestows two additional advantages to those who have Hollows along it or travel it frequently: Hollows along the trod gain an extra one-dot Hollow enhancement. The enhancement is the same for all such Hollows. This can benefit a number of Hollows equal to the Stable Trod Merit rating. This enhancement can bring the number of Hollow enhancements above the normal maximum a Hollow's rating allows. Goblin fruit trees cultivated along the trod produce additional fruit. You may roll your character's dots in Stable Trod as a dice pool once per story. Each success produces one additional generic fruit, which contains a point of Glamour.",

Perhaps she traded away her name for an enchanted mirror at a Goblin Market. Perhaps she took the riding crop as a trophy when she killed the Huntsman, and now she's driven to hunt her own kind. Whatever the case, choose one or more tokens with a total dot rating equal to her rating in this Merit. She may have more than five dots in this Merit, but no single token may have a rating higher than five. You can purchase an oath-forged token by adding one dot to its effective rating; thus, you can't purchase a five-dot oath-forged token with this Merit.
