"""
Vampire Ritual Magic Systems for Chronicles of Darkness 2nd Edition.

This module contains ritual magic systems (Scales of the Dragon, Theban Sorcery, and Cruac).
These are covenant-specific supernatural powers that work differently from Disciplines.

Ritual magic uses:
- Ranks (1-5 dots) instead of progressive discipline levels  
- Target numbers for dice pools
- Opposition mechanics for contested rolls
- Material components or sacraments
- Longer casting times than instant discipline powers
