        "cost": "•• to •••",
        "description": "Born for water, a creature with this Favor has fins, sleek skin or scales, and the breathing and muscular development that makes him native to water. He can dive and swim as naturally as a land-based beast walks. In water, his Movement trait reflects swimming, not walking; in fact, his land-based Move may be half of the normal trait... assuming he can move on land at all in anything but his human form.",
        "system": "For two dots, the character can swim like a fish in his animal forms; for three, he can dive in human form as well. A character with this Favor can dive 100 feet for each point of Stamina he possesses (in that form) if his Nahual is native to land, 1,000 feet per point if his Nahual is native to water. This trait is free for water-based creatures.",

        "cost": "•",
        "description": "In the deep canyons of the ocean, sunlight never goes. Nevertheless, weird constellations of light drift and circulate in the darkness, as bioluminescent fish live out their lives in the abyss. Likewise, lightning bugs pulse with incandescent glows. A character with this Favor emits light from some portion of his body—or perhaps all of it.",
        "system": "The light is roughly equal to that of a powerful flashlight; in game terms, the light eliminates up to two points of dice penalties for acting in darkness. The character can turn this Favor on or off at will, as a reflexive action, and the Favor costs no Essence to employ. The store of luminescent chemicals must 'recharge' after each usage (10 minutes). The effect lasts for one scene. In darkness, other characters gain a +2 bonus to attack the feral while he glows. For creatures with natural bioluminescence, this Favor is free.",

        "system": "This perception in always 'on' in any form, and costs no Essence to employ. Darksight also helps a character in visually-adverse conditions, such as dense fog, smoke or a heavy downpour, by halving all of her sight-based penalties (rounding down).",

        "system": "A character with multiple limbs can get one extra action (limb only, no movement/dodging) for every two limbs after the first. A multi-armed feral adds +1 to Defense for every limb after the third. He can attack multiple opponents on the same basis. No off-hand penalties apply.

        "system": "Free breed favor: claws/teeth add +1 die to hand-to-hand attacks; horns/antlers add +2 dice. For •: add an additional die to the attack, OR buy the attack for a beast that doesn't usually get it free, OR allow use in Man-Guise. For ••: sheathe claws even if species cannot normally do so. For •••: sheathe claws in human form and add +1 to attacks when employed.",

Characters sprayed directly take -3 penalty to Composure roll. Each character within 300 feet suffers -3 penalty to dice pools, and Defense/Speed/Initiative have one level subtracted.

If feral wins, subtract opponent's armor from total = bashing damage (doesn't heal until quills removed). Removing quills: 1 minute per Health point + 1 lethal damage. For ••: bristling quills. For •••: can fire them up to 15 feet (Dexterity + Feral Heart roll). For each additional point (up to +3): quills larger, add +1 die to quill-based dice pool.

        "system": "When enemy makes successful Brawl attack (or is grabbed/pressed against skin), he automatically takes 1 lethal damage. If using a weapon, weapon sustains 2 Structure damage.

        "system": "No roll needed in Primal Beast form unless attempting difficult maneuver, hindered, or contending with severe weather (Dexterity + Athletics). In War-Beast form must make Dexterity + Athletics roll every turn to fly/glide. Cannot fly in human form, but can jump twice as far as normal due to light bone structure.
