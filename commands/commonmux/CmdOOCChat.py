    Out-of-character communication in the current room.

    Usage:
      ooc <message>          - Say something OOC
      ooc :<action>          - Pose an action OOC
      ooc ;<action>          - Pose an action OOC (no space)

    Examples:
      ooc Hi everyone!
      > <OOC> Soma says, "Hi everyone!"

      ooc :waves to the group.
      > <OOC> Soma waves to the group.

      ooc ;grins.
      > <OOC> Soma grins.

    This command allows you to communicate out-of-character with others
    in your current location. Unlike IC speech, OOC messages are always
    understood by everyone regardless of language settings, and they
    ignore IC restrictions like Quiet Rooms.
