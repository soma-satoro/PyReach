# Unified Mystery Investigation System

## Overview

The mystery investigation system has been consolidated from two separate command structures (`+investigation` for players and `+mystery` for staff) into a single, unified `+mystery` command that handles both player investigation and staff management functionality through role-based switches.

## Key Changes

### Before (Fragmented System)
- **Player Commands**: `+investigation` with switches like `/examine`, `/search`, `/interview`
- **Staff Commands**: `+mystery` with switches like `/create`, `/addclue`, `/grant`
- **Clue Objects**: Separate `+clueobj` command for staff
- **Duplicate Code**: Similar discovery logic in both files
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different from established codebase patterns

### After (Unified System)
- **Single Command**: `+mystery` handles all functionality
- **Role-Based Access**: Automatic permission checking for staff functions
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows established command structure like BBS system
- **Streamlined Code**: Single discovery method, no duplication
- **Integrated Clue Objects**: Managed through `/clueobj/` subcommands

## Command Structure

### Player Investigation Commands
```
+mystery                          - List active mysteries you can participate in
+mystery <mystery_id>             - View mystery details and your progress
+mystery/progress [mystery_id]    - Show your investigation progress
+mystery/examine <object>         - Carefully examine an object for clues
+mystery/search [area]            - Search an area for hidden clues
+mystery/interview <character>    - Interview someone for information
+mystery/research <topic>         - Research a topic (requires library/resources)
+mystery/share <character> = <clue_name> - Share a mystery clue with another character
+mystery/collaborate <character>  - Begin collaborating on investigations
```

### Staff Mystery Management Commands
```
+mystery/create <title> = <description>
+mystery/list [category]          - List all mysteries (staff view)
+mystery/view <mystery_id>        - View mystery details (staff view)
+mystery/edit <mystery_id>/<field> = <value>
+mystery/delete <mystery_id>
+mystery/status <mystery_id> = <active|solved|suspended>

+mystery/addclue <mystery_id> = <name>/<description>
+mystery/editclue <mystery_id>/<clue_id> = <field>/<value>
+mystery/delclue <mystery_id>/<clue_id>
+mystery/prereq <mystery_id>/<clue_id> = <prerequisite_clue_ids>
+mystery/leads <mystery_id>/<clue_id> = <leads_to_clue_ids>

+mystery/conditions <mystery_id>/<clue_id> = <conditions_json>
+mystery/skillroll <mystery_id>/<clue_id> = <skill>/<attribute>/<difficulty>
+mystery/revelation <mystery_id>/<trigger_id> = <required_clues>/<revelation>
+mystery/access <mystery_id> = <templates|characters|areas>

+mystery/discovered <mystery_id> [character]
+mystery/grant <character> = <mystery_id>/<clue_id>
+mystery/revoke <character> = <mystery_id>/<clue_id>

+mystery/templates                - List available mystery templates
+mystery/template <template_name> = [custom_title] - Create from template
```

### Staff Clue Object Commands
```
+mystery/clueobj/create <name> = <mystery_id>/<clue_id>
+mystery/clueobj/edit <object> = <field>/<value>
+mystery/clueobj/list [here]
+mystery/clueobj/delete <object>
```

## Permission System

The unified system uses the existing permission framework:

- **Player Commands**: No permission check required - available to all players
- **Staff Commands**: Require `check_mystery_permission()` which checks for:
  - Staff permissions (`builders`, `admin`, `staff`)
  - Storyteller flag (`caller.db.storyteller`)

## Aliases

The command supports multiple aliases for backward compatibility:
- `+mystery` (primary)
- `+investigation` (for player familiarity)
- `+inv` (short form)
- `+mysteries` (plural form)
- `+mystadmin` (for staff familiarity)

## Future Enhancements

The unified system provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

1. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Better mechanics for group investigations
2. **Advanced Discovery**: More sophisticated clue discovery conditions
3. **Dynamic Mysteries**: Time-based or event-triggered mystery evolution
4. **Investigation Tools**: Specialized equipment or abilities for investigations
5. **Reporting System**: Better tracking and reporting of investigation progress

The system is also designed to easily support:
- Mystery templates (placeholder methods exist)
- Advanced revelation triggers
- Time-based mystery mechanics (cron/scripted)
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Reporting and analytics for staff
