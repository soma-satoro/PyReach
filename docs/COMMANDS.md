## Important Notes

### Global Search & Alias Support

**Global Character Targeting:**
- All character-targeting commands search the entire game world by default
- You can target any character anywhere, not just in your current location
- Commands work on both **online and offline characters** (except communication commands)
- No need to be in the same room to use commands like `+finger`, `+stat`, `+sheet`, etc.
- Communication commands (`page`, `+txt`) require the target to be online to receive messages

**Alias System:**
- Players can set short aliases with `alias me=<name>`
- All 71+ character-targeting commands support aliases
- Aliases work exactly like character names in every command
- Case-insensitive matching (finds "lys", "Lys", "LYS")
- Globally unique (no two characters can have the same alias)

**Examples:**
```
alias me=Lys                    # Set your alias
page Lys=Hello!                 # Works with alias (if Lys is online)
+finger Lys                     # Works with alias (offline ok, global)
+stat Lys/strength=3            # Staff can use aliases (offline ok, global)
+sheet Lys                      # View sheet (offline ok, global)
+combat/attack Lys              # Works in combat (MUST be same room + online)
+mystery/grant Lys=1/clue0      # Grant clue (offline ok, global)
