## ðŸŽ¯ **Clue Types & Required Methods**

### **Clue Type Categories**

| Clue Type | Required Method | Description | Example |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Academic** | Research | Scholarly information, historical records | "University records show..." |
| **Occult** | Occult | Supernatural knowledge, ritual information | "Ancient grimoire mentions..." |
| **Physical** | Examine | Physical evidence, visible details | "Scratches on the door..." |
| **Hidden** | Search | Concealed items, secret compartments | "Hidden behind the bookshelf..." |
| **Social** | Interview | Information from people, gossip | "Local bartender knows..." |
| **General** | Any | Can be discovered by any method | "Common knowledge..." |

### **Strategic Investigation**

Players must now think strategically about their approach:

- **Academic clues** won't be found by searching rooms - they require library research
- **Occult clues** need specialized occult research, not regular academics
- **Physical clues** require careful examination of objects
- **Hidden clues** need systematic searching of areas
- **Social clues** require talking to the right people

## ðŸ”§ **Staff Commands for Clue Types**

### **Set Clue Type** - `+mystery/cluetype <mystery_id>/<clue_id> = <type>`
Automatically sets appropriate required methods:
```
+mystery/cluetype 1/clue_0 = academic    # Requires research
+mystery/cluetype 1/clue_1 = occult      # Requires occult
+mystery/cluetype 1/clue_2 = physical    # Requires examine
+mystery/cluetype 1/clue_3 = hidden      # Requires search
+mystery/cluetype 1/clue_4 = social      # Requires interview
+mystery/cluetype 1/clue_5 = general     # Any method works
```

### **Manual Method Setting** - `+mystery/methods <mystery_id>/<clue_id> = <methods>`
For complex clues requiring multiple methods:
```
+mystery/methods 1/clue_0 = research,occult    # Requires both academic AND occult research
+mystery/methods 1/clue_1 = examine,search    # Can be found by examination OR search
+mystery/methods 1/clue_2 =                   # Clear restrictions (any method)
```

## ðŸŽ® **Player Experience**

### **Method Feedback**
When players use the wrong method, they get helpful hints:

```
> +mystery/search
You search here thoroughly but find nothing of interest.
Hint: Try using +mystery/research or +mystery/interview for other types of clues.
```

### **Clue Details**
Players can view discovered clues with `+mystery/clue <name>`:
```
> +mystery/clue "ash symbol"
=== Ash Symbol ===
Mystery: The Missing Heir
Description: A strange ash symbol burned into the wooden floor...
Tags: occult, supernatural

### **Strategic Planning**
Players must consider:
- **Location**: Are they in the right place? (library for research, etc.)
- **Method**: What type of clue are they looking for?
- **Skills**: Do they have the right skills for the method?
- **Collaboration**: Can they work with others who have different strengths?
